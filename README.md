FBK is a publicly-hosted chat bot for your [Discord](https://discord.com/) server. 

# Add FBK to your Discord server

FBK is now available for invite and public use, I have not done any sort of advertising yet, but feel free to use it or share it.

#### [Invite link granting permissions necessary for ALL bot features](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1099700181018103909&permissions=288681168&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

##### [Invite link granting Administrator (all permissions+view all channels)](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1099700181018103909&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot). For security, this is not recommended unless you have a small server and do not want to deal with permissions.

##### [Invite link granting basic/minimum permissions](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1099700181018103909&permissions=3468352&scope=bot%20applications.commands). This is sufficient for basic commands+music bot functionality. If using any more complex features, (for example: auto-roles, renaming channels for livestreams, or moderation logs) you will need to grant the required permissions to the bot through the Discord role system manually, or the bot **will not function properly.**
